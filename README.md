# How to make a Tequila Sunrise 
React app made with help from TheCocktailDB api.

## Features
You can search for a drink (alchoholic or non-alcoholic) either by the drink's name, one of the ingredients it has, or get a random drink from the database.

### Disclaimer
App still in development. 

### Future features to implement
- Fix the ingredient search option to get a result to show for ingredients with more than one word on the name.
- Show more than one drink result when searching by ingredient.
- Add local storage to save favorite drinks with a button.
